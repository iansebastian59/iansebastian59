I'm currently an undergraduate student in Bandung Institute of Technology, majoring in mathematics. 
At the moment, I am learning the fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Learning. 
The language I am most comfortable with is Python. I haven't created many projects, but I have built a simple image classifier using Tensorflow's Keras. 
Look forward for more! âœ¨
